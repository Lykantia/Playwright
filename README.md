# Playwright Learning Project

This project serves as a personal exercise for developing skills in automated testing using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).  
The goal is to learn how to write effective, clear, and maintainable tests according to best practices while also learning how to work with GitHubâ€”including version control, creating branches, and working with pull requests.
